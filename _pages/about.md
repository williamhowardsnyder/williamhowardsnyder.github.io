I'm William, a second year MS student at the University of Washington studying computer science.
I am broadly interested in machine learning, algorithm design, and reasoning under uncertainty, with applications in biology and medicine.
Recently, I have been particularly excited about applying tools from these areas to estimate uncertainty in phylogenetic inference on large viral datasets.
I'm currently exploring this topic as a graduate researcher in the [Matsen Group](https://matsen.fredhutch.org/) at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

I attained a BS (2022) at the University of Washington in Computer Science, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Sheng Wang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~swang/) for my undergraduate thesis, as well as [Erick Matsen](https://matsen.fredhutch.org/) for a research internship at FHCRC.
I also attained a BA (2022) in Philosophy, where I studied normative subjects like Ethics and Epistemology.

Outside of school, I enjoy playing board games with friends, going on walks with my wife, and I recently started doing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

You can reach me at howarwil[at]cs[dot]washington[dot]edu.
