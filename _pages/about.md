I'm William, a first year PhD student at the Princeton studying computer science.
I am broadly interested in machine learning, algorithm design, and reasoning under uncertainty, with applications in biology and medicine.

During my Masters (2024), I worked in the [Matsen Lab](https://matsen.fredhutch.org/) on methods for estimating uncertainty in phylogenetic inference for large viral datasets.
I attained a BS (2022) at the University of Washington in Computer Science, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Sheng Wang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~swang/) for my undergraduate thesis, as well as [Erick Matsen](https://matsen.fredhutch.org/) for two wonderful research internships at Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center.
I also attained a BA (2022) in Philosophy, where I studied normative subjects like Ethics and Epistemology.

Outside of school, I enjoy playing board games with friends, going on walks with my wife, and I recently started doing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.

You can reach me at [firstname]122899[at]gmail[dot]com.
