I'm William, a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Princeton University.
My work focuses on machine learning, algorithm design, and reasoning under uncertainty, with applications in biology and medicine.

In 2024, I completed my Master's at the University of Washington, where I worked in the [Matsen Lab](https://matsen.fredhutch.org/) on improving uncertainty estimation for phylogenetic inference in large viral datasets. During my undergraduate years, I earned a BS in Computer Science and a BA in Philosophy (both in 2022), where I explored topics ranging from algorithms to normative ethics. My undergraduate thesis was supervised by Prof. [Sheng Wang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~swang/), and I also had the opportunity to work with [Erick Matsen](https://matsen.fredhutch.org/) during two research internships at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

Outside of research, I enjoy strategy board games, walking with my wife, and practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
